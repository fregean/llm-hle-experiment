Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n","\n","First, I remember that elliptic curves have a group structure, and the torsion subgroup consists of all the points on the curve with finite order. The question is specifically about non-cyclic torsion subgroups, which means we're looking for the largest possible size of such a subgroup.\n","\n","I recall that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a field is cyclic if the field has certain properties, like being a field of characteristic not dividing the order of the multiplicative group. But \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})\\) is a field extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), so I need to consider its characteristics.\n","\n","Wait, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})\\) has characteristic 0, right? So, in characteristic 0, the torsion subgroup is always cyclic. But the question is about non-cyclic torsion subgroups. That seems contradictory because if the torsion subgroup is cyclic, it can't be non-cyclic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n","\n","Hold on, perhaps the question is referring to the structure of the torsion subgroup in terms of its rank or something else. Or maybe it's considering the torsion points themselves, not the subgroup structure. Let me think.\n","\n","In an elliptic curve over a field, the torsion subgroup is either trivial or cyclic of order 2, 3, 4, or 6. The order depends on the field and the curve. For example, over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), the torsion subgroup is usually trivial or cyclic of order 2 or 3, depending on whether the curve has a non-trivial 2-torsion or 3-torsion.\n","\n","But \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})\\) is a quadratic extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), so it might have different properties. Specifically, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})\\) has discriminant -3, which is related to cubic fields. Wait, no, it's a quadratic field.\n","\n","I think the key here is to consider the possible orders of torsion points. The possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The largest possible order is 6. So, the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup would have order 6, which is cyclic. But the question specifies non-cyclic, so maybe it's referring to the rank of the torsion subgroup.\n","\n","Wait, no, the rank refers to the number of independent points, not the order. So, if the torsion subgroup is cyclic of order 6, it's cyclic, not non-cyclic. Therefore, the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup would have to be a direct product of cyclic groups, but in the case of elliptic curves, the torsion subgroup is either trivial or cyclic.\n","\n","This is confusing. Maybe the question is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it. If the torsion subgroup is cyclic, it can't be non-cyclic. So, perhaps the question is asking for the largest possible order of a torsion point, which is 6.\n","\n","Alternatively, maybe it's considering the structure of the Mordell-Weil group, which is abelian, so its torsion subgroup is a direct product of cyclic groups.

So, the only possible torsion subgroups are cyclic. Therefore, the concept of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup doesn't apply here.\n","\n","Maybe the question is referring to the torsion points themselves, not the subgroup.

It's defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\det(A - xI)\n","$$\n","\n","where $A$ is the adjoint matrix of $\\mathfrak{g}$, and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n","\n","So, to find $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$, I need to first construct the adjoint matrix $A$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$. The adjoint matrix is constructed using the structure constants of the Lie algebra. The structure constants define the commutators between the generators. In this case, we have the commutation relations given, which can be used to determine the structure constants.\n","\n","Let me list out the structure constants. For a Lie algebra with generators $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_6$, the structure constants $c_{ij}^k$ are defined such that:\n","\n","$$\n","[e_i, e_j] = c_{ij}^k e_k\n","$$\n","\n","Given the commutation relations:\n","\n","1. $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ implies $c_{12}^3 = 1$ and all other $c_{12}^k = 0$ for $k \\neq 3$.\n","2. $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$ implies $c_{13}^4 = 1$ and all other $c_{13}^k = 0$ for $k \\neq 4$.\n","3. $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$ implies $c_{15}^6 = 1$ and all other $c_{15}^k = 0$ for $k \\neq 6$.\n","\n","Since the algebra is 6-dimensional, the structure constants are a 6x6 matrix. However, because the commutators only involve specific generators, many of the structure constants will be zero.

The general form of the adjoint matrix for a Lie algebra with generators $e_1, \\ldots, e_n$ is a $n \\times n$ matrix where each entry $A_{ij} = c_{ijk}^k$ for $i \\neq j$, and $A_{ii} = 0$.\n","\n","So, for our case, the adjoint matrix $A$ will have non-zero entries only in the following positions:\n","\n","- $A_{23} = 1$ (from $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$),\n","- $A_{34} = 1$ (from $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$),\n","- $A_{56} = 1$ (from $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$).\n","\n","All other entries are zero.

Each row has only one non-zero entry above the diagonal, so it's a strictly upper triangular matrix with -x on the diagonal and 1s on the superdiagonal. The determinant of a strictly upper triangular matrix is zero because the product of the diagonal is (-x)^6 = x^6, but the determinant is actually the product of the eigenvalues. However, for a strictly upper triangular matrix, all eigenvalues are zero, so the determinant is zero. But that can't be right because the matrix isn't nilpotent.\n","\n","Wait, no. Let me think again. The determinant of a strictly upper triangular matrix is indeed zero because all the eigenvalues are zero, but in this case, the matrix isn't strictly upper triangular because the diagonal entries are -x, not zero. So, the determinant is (-x)^6 times the determinant of the strictly upper triangular part, which is zero. Therefore, the determinant is zero.\n","\n","But that seems counterintuitive.

Consider a 2x2 upper triangular matrix:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{pmatrix}\n","a & b \\\\\n","0 & c \\\\\n","\\end{pmatrix}\n","$$\n","\n","The determinant is ac.

Therefore, the determinant is zero.\n","\n","Wait, but in our 6x6 case, the strictly upper triangular part has 1s on the superdiagonal, so it's not zero. The determinant of the strictly upper triangular part is the product of the 1s, which is 1. Therefore, the determinant of the entire matrix is (-x)^6 * 1 = x^6.\n","\n","But that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. For a strictly upper triangular matrix, all eigenvalues are zero, so the determinant is zero. However, in our case, the diagonal entries are -x, so the determinant is (-x)^6 times the determinant of the strictly upper triangular part, which is 1. Therefore, the determinant is x^6.\n","\n","Wait, no. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. For a strictly upper triangular matrix, all eigenvalues are zero, so the determinant is zero. However, in our case, the matrix is not strictly upper triangular because the diagonal entries are -x. So, the determinant is (-x)^6 times the determinant of the strictly upper triangular part, which is 1. Therefore, the determinant is x^6.\n","\n","But that can't be right because the matrix isn't nilpotent. Wait, no. The matrix is not nilpotent because the diagonal entries are -x, not zero. So, the determinant is not zero. Let me compute the determinant step by step.\n","\n","Alternatively, I can use the fact that the determinant of a matrix with a single 1 on the superdiagonal and -x on the diagonal is (-x)^n, where n is the size of the matrix. In our case, n=6, so the determinant is (-x)^6 = x^6.\n","\n","Yes, that makes sense. So, the Poincaré polynomial is x^6.\n","\n","But wait, let me double-check with a smaller case. For a 3x3 matrix:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{pmatrix}\n","-x & 1 & 0 \\\\\n","0 & -x & 1 \\\\\n","0 & 0 & -x \\\\\n","\\end{pmatrix}\n","$$\n","\n","The determinant is (-x)^3 = -x^3.

Similarly, for the 6x6 case, the determinant is (-x)^6 = x^6.\n","\n","Therefore, the Poincaré polynomial is x^6.\n","\n","But wait, in the 3x3 case, the determinant is (-x)^3, which is -x^3. So, in the 6x6 case, it's (-x)^6 = x^6.\n","\n","Yes, that seems consistent. So, the Poincaré polynomial is x^6.\n","\n","But let me think again. The structure constants have 1s on the superdiagonal, and the diagonal is -x. So, the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which are -x repeated six times, so (-x)^6 = x^6.\n","\n","Therefore, the Poincaré polynomial is x^6.\n","\n","But wait, in the 3x3 case, the determinant is (-x)^3 = -x^3, which is different. So, why is it negative in the 3x3 case but positive in the 6x6 case?\n","\n","Ah, because in the 3x3 case, the determinant is (-x)^3 = -x^3, but in the 6x6 case, it's (-x)^6 = x^6. So, the sign depends on the size of the matrix. For even-sized matrices, the determinant is positive, and for odd-sized matrices, it's negative.\n","\n","In our case, the matrix is 6x6, so the determinant is x^6.\n","\n","Therefore, the Poincaré polynomial is x^6.\n","\n","But let me double-check with another approach. The Poincaré polynomial is the characteristic polynomial, which is the determinant of (A - xI). For a matrix with diagonal entries -x and 1s on the superdiagonal, the determinant is (-x)^n, where n is the size of the matrix. So, for n=6, it's (-x)^6 = x^6.\n","\n","Yes, that confirms it.\n","\n","So, the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ in the variable $x$ is $x^6$.\n","</think>\n","\n","The Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is found by computing the determinant of the adjoint matrix $A - xI$.
